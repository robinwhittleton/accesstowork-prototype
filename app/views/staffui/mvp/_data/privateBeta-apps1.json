I already have to get up to get ready a lot earlier than I had to before my psoriatic arthritis as everything takes me so much longer and I have to allow myself time to have breaks inbetween getting showered/dressed etc, that throwing in the added stress/anxiety of managing to get to work okay leaves me fatigued/drained, sometimes dreading going to work.\r\n",

I do not use telephone communication unless if has a speakerphone, as you know working in an office in a team, having my phone on speakerphone when talking to foster carers would not be appropriate and would not feel comfortable in doing this. I have never had a line of work that has required using a telephone so much so have been managing without. However will need to sort this out for my placement. I do not use my mobile phone in public with speaker phone on, only in my own home, sat in my car or somewhere appropriate to do so. I am currently using my colleague work phone and finding an empty room or space to make calls so I can use speaker phone, but this limtis me to receiving calls.\r\n\r\nI have been having problems with accessing a device in using a telephone, I have tried clarity amplier for my desk BT Converse Telephone however interferes with my hearing aid and screeches loudly, this was also extremely quiet that adult services lent me. I have also tried a Plantronics supraplus HW261N headset again cannot hear a thing with. The bizzare situation is that when I use my sony (music) headphones plugged into my mobile I can make a call using these, but my phone Is an IPHONE 6 and would be a lot more technical that my desk phone. I thought about trying to plug my sony headphones into my desk phone, again this is an aux and no connector available unlike a mobile.\r\n\r\nI have given access to work details from practice learning team to see if you have any suggestions or equipment that can be more appropriate in solving this problem.

    "How does your condition make it harder for you to do your job": "As a child I developed an eye condition called amblyopia (or 'lazy eye'), in which the brain suppresses the image of one (the lazy) eye whilst the other (usually stronger) eye is open. A few months ago my brain stopped suppressing my 'lazy' eye as much as it used to. Therefore I now see double, with one image being as clear as before but another semi-transparent image is overlain on top of it. To complicate things further, my lazy eye sees objects, letters, etc. sharper when looking a little off target, so this semi-transparent image is more transparent in some areas, less in others. This is quite a problem when I move my line of sight - when reading, for example - as whatever I see with my lazy eye seems to pop up suddenly here and there.\r\n\r\nAs my work requires a lot of reading I can really feel its impact on my performance and well-being: my reading speed has decreased significantly, and if I try to speed up I start to feel sick; I can't concentrate on the content of what I'm trying to read after a while and start to feel irritated; I feel the need to take a break many times throughout the day, but also feel unable to give in to the urge to close my eyes to give them a rest, as it would look strange in an open office environment; I have become very light-sensitive (at least in part due to the double image of the light source from two angles) and will get a migraine if I cannot escape the light source after 30m-1hr (incl. car lights at night, lights at work).\r\n",
    "Do you know what you need to help you with this": "YES\r\nWhat would help you? : I've spoken to two eye doctors and it seems that I can only get my eyes to work together (and hence fix the double vision) by undergoing a 3-12 month vision therapy, also called behavioural optometry This involves weekly to fortnightly training sessions with a qualified optometrist  and daily at-home exercises. Whilst it is impossible to get perfect vision in the lazy eye even with prescription lenses, this therapy will be able to establish binocular vision so that I will only see one 3D image when both eyes are open. It is expensive (several hundred pounds for the initial consultation + Â£175-Â£325 per month for the sessions, contact lenses, etc.) and not covered by the NHS, however I see no alternative for me to keep my job in the long term.\r\n\r\n===========\r\n",

My migraines have caused lesions on my brain due to burst blood vessels (a blood clot on my brainstem stops blood leaving my blood vessels quickly enough when I have the contractions of a migraine in my brain). I have requested flourescent tubes be removed as it is far too bright after moving desks this year. I have had 2 months on sickness due to my uncontrolled epilepsy, migraines, stress, depression, anxiety and suspected trigeminal neuralgia recently. Occupational Health advised I was unfit for work and I am in the middle of changing medications which has caused sleep problems. I am still anxious and very tired.\r\n",

    "How does your condition make it harder for you to do your job": "I am regularly required to deliver training and seminars and to participate in large group meetings/conversations. I suffer from tinnitus (ringing in my right ear) and considerable loss of hearing in this ear. I have also impaired hearing in my left ear, which has worsened over the past year or so. The combination of this loss of hearing and tinnitus make it often impossible for me to hear people speak, or to locate who a speaker is, which in large groups is extremely difficult to manage.  It is now impacting on my existing work and beginning to prevent me from taking on other work as I am concerned about the impact of my disability on my performance. I currently use NHS hearing aids, which help to an extent, but have become less effective in last 12 months and do not have the degree of sophisitcation that a privately purchased hearing aid would provide. This includes a tinnitus balance noise generator, hearing aids that 'speak' to each other allowing them to 'zoom' into the person speaking - helping with my ability to locate the sound, and other helpful advanced technology.\r\n",
    "Do you know what you need to help you with this": "YES\r\nWhat would help you? : Being able to use private, more sophisticated hearing aids that would be tailored to my particular hearing loss and needs. These are not available on the NHS and are quite expensive\r\n\r\n===========\r\n",

I find it difficult to see the screen as my remaining sight has decreased further and existing provisions from Access to Work (which have now been fully installed) may not be sufficient. As such, I am finding it harder to see the screen with current equipment provided by Access to Work. I also take prescription painkillers for eye pain in both eyes (differing medical conditions), whose side effects can make it difficult to travel to work safely. Due to recommended equipement not being installed by the time I started, the strain on my eyes increased and, combined with sudden eye pain in both eyes from existing conditions and the \"natural\", gradual drop in my sight and other medical issues, I had to take long term sickness.\n\n\n\nI also use my guide dog to get around the office and to find people and destinations, although further assistance with this may be needed.\n\n\n\nI would also require equipment or an assessment for working from home due to the worsening of my conditions. Due to my medical conditions and the potential side effects of my medications and any issues that occur pertaining to my guide dog, I may also be unable to work in the office.
