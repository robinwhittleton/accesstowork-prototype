I therefore end up having to make a choice about whether to see or hear\ufffd If I do wear just one hearing in the ear that does not have the headset piece, it is not adjustable in any way as you need to wear both to be able to adjust the volume\ufffd The hearing aid issued by the NHS does not have any adjustable programmes and is inadequate for the control room environment. It does not enhance speech but increases background noise, paper rustling, printers etc to an unacceptable and unworkable level.I have now found myself in the situation where I am just not wearing my hearing aid at work as it is so uncomfortable, both physically with the headset and in terms of the audio aspects of the control room environment.",

These hearing aids are fully adjustable and could be set to work specifically within the control room environment, cutting out background noise but enhancing and isolating speech.I have made some preliminary enquiries and the price range for this type of hearing aid is \ufffd1095-\ufffd3000. It is my understanding that the more expensive sets in this range have more functions and adjustable settings but hopefully a set at the lower end of this price range would suffice. All of these fit completely within the ear and would eliminate the majority of the problems I am experiencing at work with my hearing aid at the moment.

Fatigue and tiredness is particularly problematic particularly when travelling. Medications I require have side effects which impact on my physical well-being but are required in order to keep the disease under control.As I mentioned on the previous section, on many occasions wanted / needed to stay off work but have chosen not to because I am driven to prove that I can perform and do my job despite difficult circumstances. HAH certainly benefit from this. This is my choice and a recognised behaviour/ psychological response with people who work with the condition(s) I have; I prefer to maintain professionalism and be a valued and useful expert to HaH and I manage my LTCs in my personal way to ensure I am not stereo-typed and present an image which I am happy with and which does not hold me in a \u0091sick role\u0092 where I do not see myself. It would be a positive experience for me to have this recognised and understoodby HaH HR department leads.

Whilst doing this I have bought light luggage with easy grip handles and I now use a lightweight laptop. On occasion I have assistance at stations with heavy luggage. Using taxi drivers also allows for assistance with luggage. I use the principles of planning and pacing as advocated by the occupational therapist from my multidisciplinary team, as well as taking regular stops.",
    "travel_what_need": "I continue with the plan above. I need to be able to plan and flex modes of transport as a travel around the UK depending on the fluctuating symptoms at the time. Using taxis to travel from venues rather than logging equipment around on trains and aeroplanes is much easier rather than struggling. The current car I have which I am able to use on a limited basis due to current symptoms was picked by me specifically to assist with getting in and out easily and for taking items in and out of the boot with ease. Once the methotrexate begins to work I should be able to use the car a little more frequently and for longer journeys of more than half an hour but this will depend on symptoms at the time. Flexibility for use utilising different modes of transport is essential in order for me to manage this national role.I remain concerned about the cost that this incurs and it does cause me anxiety and sometimes I feel stressed to the point where I have not submitted expenses for taxi journeys. On many occasions wanted / needed to stay off work but have chosen not to because I am driven to prove that I can perform and do my job despite difficult circumstances.

As an ICT manager life is both unpredictable and often stressful \ufffd , and recently I have been diagnosed Diabetic Maculopathy so am looking for whatever forms of medication, support, routine and equipment I can access to help me lower my long term blood sugar levels. The standard answer is to keep blood sugars lower, but with the best will in the world this is far from easy as maintaining good control is akin to walking on a tightrope. As I am sure you are aware diabetes is considered a disability under the Equality Act.CGM would assist me as it continuously monitors my blood glucose levels, and alerts me if it is going high or low, allowing me to treat it with either glucose or insulin accordingly. In the long term this will help keep my glucose levels lower, in turn reducing the risk and effect of complications, which will then keep me able to fitter and able to work longer. For example if I unexpectedly go low during the day, I then experience high bloods the following night, and generally the following day is then a write-off.The costs are:One off - Dexcom G5 Receiver Kit \ufffd275Three monthly (and one off at the start) \ufffd Dexcom Mobile Transmitter Kit - \ufffd200Monthly (and one off at the start) \ufffd Dexcom G5 Sensors \ufffd205NICE guidelines state CGM can be funded by the NHS in extreme circumstances, however xxxxx decline my request.

I can then take this with me when I hot desk to other rooms. I use one of these at home and it heats a room perfectly. I cannot use hot air heaters because I also have eczema and hot air heaters cause this to flare, as well as not providing an steady temperature.2. At present I use one computer screen, on a daily basis to do my job. Some of my job role will involve analysing data, which I did in my previous job. I found having two screens useful, at present I only have one. An effect of my multiple sclerosis is that I experience transient double vision when my eyes make rapid horizontal saccades, whereas this is not so in the vertical plane. Therefore a screen which I can position vertically would be helpful.3. At present, I walk 15 minutes to an overgorund station and then catch a train to work. I make the same journey in reverse when I travel home. At present, whilst it is summer and whilst my balance, coordination and walking speed have improved, I am able to manage this.

It has been noted that I suffer with severe tightness of joints in my lumbar part of my spine disabling my movement there, I also have been advised that the joints in my neck and other parts of my spine where \ufffdlocked\ufffd. The muscle around these joints is both overtight, causing pain and discomfort, but also noted during my physiotherapy side of my treatment that the muscles are spasming during mild exercise evidencing a weakness in their ability to cope with minor activities and support my spine, particularly around the neck.This pain and muscle strain is particularly aggravated by working on my desk and I feel this is having a significant and disabling impact on my ability to perform my role.As practitioner in a drug and alcohol service, I spend a lot of time working at my desk in the office writing up case notes/emails/updating the database/writing reports. There are times when I am working at my desk on a laptop for a number of hours.When seated and working in the office, I find that multiple points on my back are unsupported, and there is a constant and increasing ache. I find that my back is considerably worse when I\ufffdve had an office intensive day at work. I often have muscle spasms in my neck, as well as stiffness and difficulty rotating my head, and headaches. I also suffer with tension and pain in my shoulders, and soreness at multiple points of my spine.Due to my pain levels and constant discomfort and I am unable to sit for prolonged periods of time therefore meaning I struggle to complete my reports in a timely manner and to the best of my ability as I have to keep getting up. I find that working on a laptop (even with a laptop riser provided by Aquarius) causes a constant strain in my neck which is associated with an increase in my headaches. This means that my thought process are affected and I struggle to concentrate.This pain then continues when I am at home, and affects my sleep, therefore meaning I am coming into work exhausted often which affects my overall mood and general motivation at work.

I take anti-inflammatories (Naproxin) and painkillers (Codine 30mg) to manage the pain however I am unable to take as much painkillers as I need at work due to having to drive as part of my role.I have to apply ice packs to my neck, shoulders, upper back, middle of my back and lower back 3 times a day. I have found that I have to do this more/for longer on days at work which are more office intense.I am having to use these whilst sitting at my desk to reduce the pain and imflamation to enable me to keep on working.When in the office I try my best to ensure that I get when I can to stand up and walk around for a few moments in order to prevent seizing up and increased stiffness.I have taken time off work at different points over the past few years due to back and neck pain, and at times I used my TOIL (Time Off in Lieu) to finish work early for the day when pain levels are particualry bad.

    "job_how_harder": "Due to my severe hearing loss, the main barrier that my disability poses is communication, especially following conversations. I rely heavily upon lip-reading, and it is very tiring lip-reading for long periods of time. In addition, it can be very difficult to lip-read everyone present in a room due to background noise or if it is a large conference- style event. The same challenges are present when attending small meetings as people speak rapidly in succession thus making it difficult to follow who is speaking and what they are speaking about. As a result, I can miss out on a lot of vital information, have difficulty joining in conversations, especially with groups of people and I can become tired more quickly.Lip-readers depend very heavily on environmental cues and a knowledge of what is likely to be said next as a number of speech sounds are pronounced deep in the larynx and therefore cannot be understood by sight alone.There are a number of scenarios which makes lip-reading difficult and these include:\ufffd Use of different rhythms/tone of voice by the speaker \ufffd Accents and dialects \ufffd Lack of clear vision of the speaker\ufffds lips. This includes obstructions to the mouth such as moustaches and hands in front of mouths and the speaker turning their head away \ufffd Background is brightened e.g. window behind speaker thus casting their face in shadow \ufffd Group discussions/team meetings \ufffd Lack of context/unfamiliar topic areas Part of my remit as the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is to inform families and professionals about events and resources. It is critical that I fully understand the information that has been given to me in order for me to convey this on in an effective and appropriate manner. As a result, it is vital that I fully understand information and conversations. I am also expected to attend a number of mandatory training days as part of my role and in order to be able to fulfil my responsibilities properly, I must be fully aware of and understand the information that I am being told. It can also be a health and safety risk if I am not fully aware of processes and procedures. As an officer, families will be seeking information and reassurance from me and they are at risk if I cannot correctly inform them about matters or misunderstand what they are asking.In order to communicate in a cogent manner, build relationships with both professionals and families and ensure that health and safety requirements are met, it is important that I am able to follow conversations and presentations. This can be done with the support of a palantypist. A palantypist is required to help me with team meetings, training courses, out-reach sessions and conferences. ",

I am a social worker working with young people in and leaving care and it is a very stressful and complex type of work, which often requires quick thinking and responses, also managing difficult and challenging behaviours, and dealing with difficult and emotional issues. My health condition makes it difficult to maintain all the expectations and i have been struggling with that. My illness is exacerbated by stress and physical activity. My role has been reviewed and changed to reduce some of the stress, but it is inevitablely part of the job. Engaging with clients and other professionals is difficult when i am ill and my mind-fog and short-term memory is poor.

I used to be full time, but my hours reduced to working 4 days, with 2 of these working from home, so that i can attend regular health appointments for my condition. I work flexibly on the 2 days i work from home. They also agreed a later starting time of 10am and finish at 6pm at the office (2 days) except for when on Duty, which is earlier. They have also provided me with a laptop to use from home, because i cannot carry around a laptop (as other staff do).
