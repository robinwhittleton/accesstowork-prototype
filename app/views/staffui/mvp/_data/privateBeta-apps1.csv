I am unable to use ladders now, as I just haven't got the strength to support myself and I always become fearful of falling, this can become a pain when things take so much longer due to having to wait for somebody to be able to lend me a hand.
As the arthritis affects my hands/wrists/fingers sometimes I even struggle to write with a pen, my wrists begin to ache a lot quicker, this becomes a pain when I need to write something down/make notes.

If I am stuck and am forced to walk, I am reduced to tears due to the pain and increased swelling in my knees and feet, my hip and back pain is greatly increased too. I often end up not being able to walk a step further, meaning I’m practically stranded, forced to wait for my partner to come and pick me up from where I am which can mean I am left waiting for 30 minutes to an hour. I already have to get up to get ready a lot earlier than I had to before my psoriatic arthritis as everything takes me so much longer and I have to allow myself time to have breaks inbetween getting showered/dressed etc, that throwing in the added stress/anxiety of managing to get to work okay leaves me fatigued/drained, sometimes dreading going to work.

When it is cold/icy outside it makes it so much more harder for me, my pain increases and the risk of falling is obviously greatly increased.

I do not use telephone communication unless if has a speakerphone, as you know working in an office in a team, having my phone on speakerphone when talking to foster carers would not be appropriate and would not feel comfortable in doing this. I have never had a line of work that has required using a telephone so much so have been managing without. However will need to sort this out for my placement. I do not use my mobile phone in public with speaker phone on, only in my own home, sat in my car or somewhere appropriate to do so. I am currently using my colleague work phone and finding an empty room or space to make calls so I can use speaker phone, but this limtis me to receiving calls.

I have been having problems with accessing a device in using a telephone, I have tried clarity amplier for my desk BT Converse Telephone however interferes with my hearing aid and screeches loudly, this was also extremely quiet that adult services lent me. I have also tried a Plantronics supraplus HW261N headset again cannot hear a thing with. The bizzare situation is that when I use my sony (music) headphones plugged into my mobile I can make a call using these, but my phone Is an IPHONE 6 and would be a lot more technical that my desk phone.

","Limited movement in right hip-joint.
","I was diagnosed with osteomyelitis  following a fall. The focus of the injury was my right hip-joint. Following a lengthy spell in hospital I began a course of occupational therapy, including wearing a shoe fitted with a raise. The prognosis was limited movement in my right hip-joint, which remains to this day.
Regular periods of discomfort may be caused by inflammation of the tendons in my right thigh. It occurs when mobility is confined, i.e. when sitting in a confined space i.e. motor vehicle or Â“shufflingÂ” in a limited area for movement. The discomfort is rarely experienced whilst walking, or sitting comfortably.
I need to take painkillers when the inflammation flares up and continue to do so until it subsides. The pain affects my concentration and I usually need to abandon activities where the distraction would compromise my work performance.

","Change in amblyopia suppression causing double vision
","As a child I developed an eye condition called amblyopia (or 'lazy eye'), in which the brain suppresses the image of one (the lazy) eye whilst the other (usually stronger) eye is open. A few months ago my brain stopped suppressing my 'lazy' eye as much as it used to. Therefore I now see double, with one image being as clear as before but another semi-transparent image is overlain on top of it. To complicate things further, my lazy eye sees objects, letters, etc. sharper when looking a little off target, so this semi-transparent image is more transparent in some areas, less in others. This is quite a problem when I move my line of sight - when reading, for example - as whatever I see with my lazy eye seems to pop up suddenly here and there.

As my work requires a lot of reading I can really feel its impact on my performance and well-being: my reading speed has decreased significantly, and if I try to speed up I start to feel sick; I can't concentrate on the content of what I'm trying to read after a while and start to feel irritated; I feel the need to take a break many times throughout the day, but also feel unable to give in to the urge to close my eyes to give them a rest, as it would look strange in an open office environment; I have become very light-sensitive (at least in part due to the double image of the light source from two angles) and will get a migraine if I cannot escape the light source after 30m-1hr (incl. car lights at night, lights at work).
","YES
What would help you? : I've spoken to two eye doctors and it seems that I can only get my eyes to work together (and hence fix the double vision) by undergoing a 3-12 month vision therapy, also called behavioural optometry This involves weekly to fortnightly training sessions with a qualified optometrist  and daily at-home exercises. Whilst it is impossible to get perfect vision in the lazy eye even with prescription lenses, this therapy will be able to establish binocular vision so that I will only see one 3D image when both eyes are open. It is expensive (several hundred pounds for the initial consultation + Â£175-Â£325 per month for the sessions, contact lenses, etc.) and not covered by the NHS, however I see no alternative for me to keep my job in the long term.

They have recommended a Widex Unique 15 channel hearing aid which sits completely in the canal and reacts quickly to sudden changes and enables the wearer to hear in groups of people in noisy environments.  I was able to trial this aid in the hospital waiting room for a short period and it was very effective.  The cost of the hearing aid is Â£3,195.

","YES
What would help you? : Having done research online and speaking with the Hospital I think the best overall solution would be a Roger Pen.  It would certainly help in meetings being able to focus on the speaker especially in the larger and public areas and in the office on occassions and the ability to connect audio directly between the laptop/computer and the aids instead of having to remove my aids each time would be very usful.  I am of course open minded to any solution that will help.

,"Severe hearing impairment
","I am regularly required to deliver training and seminars and to participate in large group meetings/conversations. I suffer from tinnitus (ringing in my right ear) and considerable loss of hearing in this ear. I have also impaired hearing in my left ear, which has worsened over the past year or so. The combination of this loss of hearing and tinnitus make it often impossible for me to hear people speak, or to locate who a speaker is, which in large groups is extremely difficult to manage.  It is now impacting on my existing work and beginning to prevent me from taking on other work as I am concerned about the impact of my disability on my performance. I currently use NHS hearing aids, which help to an extent, but have become less effective in last 12 months and do not have the degree of sophisitcation that a privately purchased hearing aid would provide. This includes a tinnitus balance noise generator, hearing aids that 'speak' to each other allowing them to 'zoom' into the person speaking - helping with my ability to locate the sound, and other helpful advanced technology.
","YES
What would help you? : Being able to use private, more sophisticated hearing aids that would be tailored to my particular hearing loss and needs. These are not available on the NHS and are quite expensive

"Incident Handler
","Registered severely sight-impaired/blind, guide dog owner, hearing impaired, chronic/severe costochondritis. Flare-up of costochondritis resulted in chest infection and damage to vocal chords for over two months- unable to speak for more than short periods or louder than a whisper.
","Sight issues:

I am registered severely sight-impaired/blind. i have no sight in my right eye and very limited sihgt in my left eye. I find it difficult to see the screen as my remaining sight has decreased further and existing provisions from Access to Work (which have now been fully installed) may not be sufficient. As such, I am finding it harder to see the screen with current equipment provided by Access to Work. I also take prescription painkillers for eye pain in both eyes (differing medical conditions), whose side effects can make it difficult to travel to work safely. Due to recommended equipement not being installed by the time I started, the strain on my eyes increased and, combined with sudden eye pain in both eyes from existing conditions and the ""natural"", gradual drop in my sight and other medical issues, I had to take long term sickness.



I also use my guide dog to get around the office and to find people and destinations, although further assistance with this may be needed.



I would also require equipment or an assessment for working from home due to the worsening of my conditions. Due to my medical conditions and the potential side effects of my medications and any issues that occur pertaining to my guide dog, I may also be unable to work in the office. As such working from home conditions should be recommended, as advised by Occupational Health.

","YES
What would help you? : Office:
I may require higher resolution monitors to allow me to zoom in on text with greater clarity. Ideally, these would need to be compatible with the existing monitor arms. A new workspace would be appreciated.
Home Working:
Workspace assessment would be required.

","Meeting with clients or potential clients, and communicating at industry events/professional networking events is very difficult for me due to my hearing loss and the amount of background noise or multiple speakers in these kind of situations. Phone calls are also difficult. My difficulty with these situatons make it harder for me to attract new clients and jobs.
","YES
What would help you? : My NHS Audiologist has suggested a wireless accessory (the Phonak Roger Pen) that works as a directional or omni-directional microphone that would stream sound directly to my hearing aids. I would be able to point the 'pen' at someone I'm speaking to, or place it in the centre of the table at meetings. It will also stream the audio from my phone so that I can hear phone calls clearly. I need to acquire the Roger Pen plus two receivers that fit on to my NHS hearing aids. The NHS will provide the compatible aids but not any of these accessories.
