I try to place myself on desks where there is less or no traffic (people walking) behind me as otherwise concentration can also be impacted. The receiver in my appointment was really effective and helped to mute the tinnitus and really helped with conversation when it wasn't 1:1 as the clarity of words was significantly better and required little concentration to absorb and understand.
