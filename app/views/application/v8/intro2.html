	 <h2 class="heading-medium">2. Eligibility</h2>
	 <p>Access to Work grants are only available if you live and work in England, Scotland or Wales. There's a different system in <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/access-to-work-practical-help-at-work">Northern Ireland.</a></p>
	 <p>You must be 16 or over and either:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>about to start a job or work trial</li>
      <li>in a paid job or self-employed (you can’t get a grant for voluntary work)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You might also qualify if you’re getting <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-enterprise-allowance" target="_blank">New Enterprise Allowance</a> or starting work experience under a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-from-benefits-to-work/job-search-programmes" target="_blank">Youth Contract</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Your condition</h2>
    <p>Your disability or health condition must affect your ability to do a job or mean you have to pay work-related costs. For example, if you need to buy computer equipment or have to take taxis because you can’t use public transport.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Exceptions</h2>
    <p>You might not qualify if you get any of these benefits:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
      <li>Job Seekers Allowance</li>
      <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Severe Disability Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>National Insurance Credits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Changing jobs</h2>
    <p>You may be able to take any special equipment that's been paid for with an Access to Work Grant with you if you change jobs. If you get regular grants (eg for travel to work) you'll have to apply for a new grant.</p>
