	 <h2 class="heading-medium">2. Eligibility</h2>
	 <p>You can only apply for an Access to Work grant if you live and work in England, Scotland or Wales. There's a different system in <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/access-to-work-practical-help-at-work">Northern Ireland.</a></p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Your condition</h2>
    <p>Your disability or health condition must affect your ability to do your job or mean you have to pay work-related costs. For example, if you need to buy computer equipment or have to take taxis because you canâ€™t use public transport.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Other benefits</h2>
    <p>You might not get a grant if you already get any of:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
      <li>Job Seekers Allowance</li>
      <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Severe Disability Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>National Insurance Credits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Changing jobs</h2>
    <p>You may be able to take any special equipment that's been paid for with an Access to Work grant with you if you change jobs.</p>
    <p>If you get a grant for travel costs you'll have to apply for a new grant if you change your place of work.</p>
