  <h2 class="heading-medium">Insight</h2>
  <p>We've used rather open ended questions because we need to try and cover such a wide range of different scenarios. However, users find these slightly difficult to understand.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>By taking users through a number of "guesses" at what their problem might be we'd provide much more specific questions which users will find easier to understand and answer. Also by using the task & describe pattern in a similar format at the end of the process we could still allow anyone who has a more unusual problem to inform us what it is.
