Unknown - emailed feedback,17-Jan-2016,n/a,"1) I am relieved I have been able to make my application online and at the weekend, as I did not feel able to discuss the matter at work as colleagues would have been listening.

2) The form was simple and straight forward and I was able to navigate it easily. ","1) I would have liked the form to be available on the access to work website, although I understand this may be a new system you are trialling. 

2) Working for a Government department I understand how the internet is being used more, if customers are happy to use it then there should be an acceptable email policy in each department. 

3) A separate section before Submit to add anything I felt I had forgotten to mention would have been helpful, or the ability to go back to the previous page and add further information if necessary.

2) Some facility to review the completed document before sending would be useful

3) the opportunity to download a copy for your own records.  Since I can't see what I've sent, I'm not sure that I have completed the form to the best of my ability, or that I haven't missed something out.

BEC73,01-Feb-2016,Dissatisfied,1) I was very happy to actually be able to finally complete this application today. ,"1) I sent off my application using this service several weeks ago, only to be told they hadn't received it. I was then told to reapply, when I did, I got all the way to the end of the application and it came up with an error saying I ""didn't have access to view this page"" which meant I couldn't apply again! I had to then email again to ask for a new link, which has now been successful so far!

2) I know this is a new service, so just making sure things like that don't happen again would improve this service greatly, perhaps sending an email out too, to let applicants know their applications were received properly and being looked into. As with mine, I had no idea they hadn't received it until a week later!

F097F,01-Feb-2016,Dissatisfied,"1) Thank you though for trying to providing financial support.  I think that's great :)
","1) I first contacted Access to Work in August 2015.  I have tried calling and emailing, and today I've been prompted to complete this online form. I've yet to speak to a real person.

2) I think it is fantastic that the government is trying to provide support for people with dissabilities, but I find the process you have to go through to get it is impersonal and daunting.  

3) I generally don't mind filling out application forms, but somehow this one made me feel very uncomfortable.

4) Also, it would be good if you would provide an option to review answers given before submitting it and also to print and/or save a copy.
