			<p>This shouldn't delay you getting other parts of your offer if you need them more urgently.</p>
			<p>You must report any changes to your life or work that could affect your grant, for example if your condition improves or you move house.</p>

              <p>You may be asked to repay any money you claim through your grant that's not used to pay for the help or items listed in your offer letter.
